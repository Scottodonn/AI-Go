## How It Works

### 1. **User Input Collection**
Users provide three key pieces of information:
- **Investment Amount**: How much they want to invest
- **Time Horizon**: When they'll need the money back
- **Risk Tolerance**: How much volatility they're comfortable with

### 2. **Database Filtering**
The algorithm filters our comprehensive database of stocks and ETFs based on:
- **Affordability**: Investment minimums they can meet
- **Time Suitability**: Investments appropriate for their timeline
- **Risk Compatibility**: Investments matching or below their risk tolerance

### 3. **Intelligent Scoring**
Each qualifying investment receives a score based on:
- **Expected returns** for their risk level
- **Diversification benefits** (ETFs preferred for beginners)
- **Fee structure** (lower fees get higher scores)
- **Volatility match** with user preferences
- **Dividend income** for conservative investors

### 4. **Portfolio Construction**
The system creates a diversified portfolio with:
- **Strategic allocation** based on risk tolerance
- **Rebalancing** to ensure 100% allocation
- **Minimum investment requirements** respected
- **Clear reasoning** for each recommendation
